# Storage Types on AWS

AWS storage services are grouped into three main categories: file storage, block storage, and object storage. Each type serves different use cases and has unique characteristics.

## File Storage

File storage organizes data into a tree-like hierarchy of folders and subfolders, similar to Windows File Explorer or MacOS Finder. Each file in this system has metadata (such as file name, file size, and creation date) and a path that indicates its location in the hierarchy.

### Use Cases

- **Large content repositories**
- **Development environments**
- **User home directories**

### Characteristics

- **Centralized access**: Multiple host computers can share and manage files.
- **File locking**: Ensures data consistency when accessed by multiple hosts.
- **File system protocols**: Integrates with existing communication protocols.

## Block Storage

Block storage splits files into fixed-size chunks called blocks, each with a unique address. This allows for efficient retrieval and updating of data.

### Use Cases

- **High-performance enterprise workloads**: Databases and ERP systems.
- **Low-latency operations**: Optimized for fast data access and minimal bandwidth usage.

### Characteristics

- **Addressable blocks**: Each block can be individually accessed and updated.
- **No additional metadata**: Only the address is associated with each block, making updates quick and efficient.

## Object Storage

Object storage treats data as single units called objects, stored in a flat structure. Each object includes a unique identifier and metadata bundled with the data.

### Use Cases

- **Large data sets**
- **Unstructured files**: Media assets and static assets (e.g., photos).

### Characteristics

- **Scalability**: No limit to the number of objects stored.
- **Flat structure**: No hierarchical organization.
- **Complete updates**: Modifying data requires updating the entire object.

## Relating to Traditional Storage Systems

If you're familiar with on-premises storage, here's how cloud storage compares:

- **Block storage**: Similar to direct-attached storage (DAS) or a storage area network (SAN).
- **File storage**: Supported by network-attached storage (NAS) servers.

### Flexibility in the Cloud

In traditional data centers, adding storage requires purchasing, installing, and configuring hardware. In the cloud, you can create, delete, and modify storage solutions in minutes, offering greater flexibility and scalability.
