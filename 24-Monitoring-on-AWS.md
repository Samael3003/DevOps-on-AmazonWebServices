## Monitoring on AWS

### Importance of Monitoring
Monitoring your AWS resources helps you understand the operational health and usage of your systems, enabling you to:

- **Track Visitors and Performance**: Understand how many people visit your site, track visitor numbers over time, and identify performance issues.
- **Proactive Issue Resolution**: Address issues before end users are impacted, improving reliability and user satisfaction.
- **Security**: Detect and respond to security threats by recognizing anomalies from a baseline of normal activity.
- **Business Decisions**: Make informed decisions based on data, such as user engagement with new features.
- **Cost Optimization**: Identify underutilized resources and optimize them to reduce costs.

### Key Metrics to Monitor
Different AWS resources produce various metrics. Examples include:

- **EC2 Instances**: CPU utilization, network utilization, disk performance, memory utilization, and application logs.
- **S3 Buckets**: Overall size, number of objects, read/write request metrics.
- **RDS Instances**: Database connections, CPU utilization, disk space consumption.

### Benefits of Monitoring
- **Proactive Issue Resolution**: Respond to operational issues before users are aware.
- **Performance and Reliability Improvement**: Identify and resolve bottlenecks and inefficiencies.
- **Security Threat Recognition**: Spot anomalies and investigate potential security events.
- **Data-Driven Decisions**: Use metrics to inform business strategies and feature development.
- **Cost-Effective Solutions**: Right-size resources based on usage to optimize costs.
