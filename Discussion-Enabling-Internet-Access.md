### Enabling Internet Access for an Amazon EC2 Instance in a VPC

To enable internet traffic to flow to and from an Amazon EC2 instance deployed into a subnet in a Virtual Private Cloud (VPC), follow these steps:

1. **Attach an Internet Gateway to the VPC**:
   - Go to the VPC Dashboard in the AWS Management Console.
   - Create an Internet Gateway if one doesn’t exist.
   - Attach the Internet Gateway to your VPC.

2. **Modify the Route Table**:
   - Create a custom route table or modify the existing one.
   - Add a route that directs traffic destined for the internet (0.0.0.0/0) to the Internet Gateway.

3. **Configure the Subnet**:
   - Associate the custom route table with the subnet where your EC2 instance is deployed.

4. **Update Security Groups**:
   - Go to the Security Groups section in the EC2 Dashboard.
   - Add inbound rules to allow HTTP (port 80), HTTPS (port 443), and any other required ports (e.g., SSH on port 22) from the internet (0.0.0.0/0).
   - Add outbound rules to allow traffic to the internet.

5. **Update Network ACLs (Optional)**:
   - Ensure the subnet’s Network ACL allows inbound and outbound traffic on the necessary ports.
   - Default ACLs allow all traffic, but custom ACLs might need specific rules for HTTP, HTTPS, and other traffic.

### Differences Between Network ACLs and Security Groups

**Network ACLs (NACLs)**:
- **Stateless**: Rules apply to both inbound and outbound traffic independently.
- **Subnet Level**: Operate at the subnet level, controlling traffic entering and leaving the subnet.
- **Rule Evaluation**: Rules are evaluated in numerical order (lowest to highest).
- **Default Deny**: Default is to deny all traffic unless explicitly allowed.

**Security Groups**:
- **Stateful**: Automatically allow return traffic for outbound requests.
- **Instance Level**: Operate at the instance level, controlling traffic to and from the instance.
- **Rule Evaluation**: All rules are evaluated before deciding to allow traffic.
- **Default Allow**: Default is to allow all outbound traffic and deny all inbound traffic unless explicitly allowed.

### Summary
By attaching an Internet Gateway to the VPC, updating the route table, and configuring security groups and Network ACLs, you can ensure your EC2 instance is accessible from the internet. Understanding the differences between Network ACLs and Security Groups helps in managing and securing your AWS environment effectively.
