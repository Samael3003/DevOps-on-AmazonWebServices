# Protect the AWS Root User

## Understanding Authentication and Authorization

### Authentication
Authentication is the process of verifying the identity of a user. Common methods include:
- Username and password
- Token-based authentication
- Biometric data (e.g., fingerprint)

### Authorization
Authorization is the process of granting permissions to users to access AWS resources and services. It determines what actions a user can perform.

## AWS Root User

### What Is the AWS Root User?
The AWS root user is the initial account identity created when you set up your AWS account. It has complete access to all AWS services, resources, billing, and personal information.

### AWS Root User Credentials
The root user has two sets of credentials:
1. **Email and Password**: Used to access the AWS Management Console.
2. **Access Keys**: Consist of an Access Key ID and a Secret Access Key, used for programmatic access via the AWS CLI or AWS API.

### Best Practices for Root User Security
- Choose a strong password for the root user.
- Never share the root user password or access keys.
- Disable or delete the root user access keys.
- Avoid using the root user for everyday tasks or administrative functions.

## Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)

### Importance of MFA
MFA enhances security by requiring two or more forms of authentication from different categories:
- **Something you know**: Username, password, or PIN.
- **Something you have**: One-time passcode from a hardware device or mobile app.
- **Something you are**: Biometric data like fingerprint or face scanning.

### Enabling MFA on AWS
To protect your AWS root user, enable MFA. This requires:
1. An email and password combination.
2. A temporary numeric code from an MFA device.

### Supported MFA Devices
AWS supports various MFA mechanisms:
- **Virtual MFA**: Software apps providing one-time passcodes (e.g., Authy, Duo Mobile, LastPass Authenticator, Microsoft Authenticator, Google Authenticator).
- **Hardware MFA**: Physical devices generating one-time numeric codes (e.g., key fobs, display cards).
- **U2F Devices**: Hardware devices plugging into a USB port (e.g., YubiKey).

## Deleting Root User Access Keys
If you have an access key for your root user and want to delete it:
1. Go to the **My Security Credentials** page in the AWS Management Console.
2. Sign in with the root userâ€™s email address and password.
3. Open the **Access keys** section.
4. Under **Actions**, click **Delete**.
5. Confirm by clicking **Yes**.

## Conclusion
Securing the AWS root user is crucial for maintaining the integrity and security of your AWS account. By following best practices, enabling MFA, and carefully managing root user credentials, you can significantly reduce the risk of unauthorized access.
